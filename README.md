# Atomic Orbital
This library contains the basic tools to plot the atomic orbitals using spherical harmonics as well as the vibrating function psi of the orbitals of a hydrogenlike atom, given the three integer positive numbers n, l and ml, respectively main quantic number, orbital quantic number and magnetic quantic number.

## Spherical harmonics
The shape of the Spherical harmonics is given by the absolute value of the following complex function function:
$$Y_{l, m_l} (\theta, \phi) = (-1)^{m_l} \[ \frac{2l+1}{4\pi}\frac{(l-m_l)!}{(l+m_l)!}\]^{\frac{1}{2}}P^{m_l}_l(\cos\theta)e^{im_l\phi}$$
where $P^{m_l}_l(\cos\theta)$ is the Legendre Polynomial with of l degree and $m_l$ order.

## hydrogenlike atomic orbitals
The shape of this orbital are not constant, in fact they depends on the radius from the center of the atom. In general the function used to compute the orbitals, depends on the form of the potential chosen, and it is solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation in the spherical coordinates system.
$$\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2{\theta}}\left[ \sin{\theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left ( \sin{\theta}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \varphi^2} \right] + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(2w +U)\phi = 0$$
